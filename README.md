**Playlists as art. Built to share, express, and connect through music.**

## What is Wheelhouse?

Wheelhouse is a fun and expressive way to make playlists.  

You can:
- Build custom playlists with colors, emojis, and moods  
- Add songs from YouTube (Spotify and Apple Music coming later)  
- Leave comments on the waveform. 
- Blog about your favorite songs and albums  
- Add friends, compare taste, and swap recs  

## MVP Goals

- Playlist builder (YouTube only for now)  
- Simple custom audio player  
- Waveform comments  
- User profiles with music blog  
- Light social layer (add friends, see their stuff)
