### Wheelhouse

I wanted to bring back the soul of the mixtape era, where sharing music felt personal,
thoughtful, and creative. This project is my attempt to reimagine playlists as living,
expressive artifacts — part blog, part collage, part conversation. It’s built for people
who want to show what music means to them, connect over shared tastes, and tell stories
through songs.

- Expressive Playlists – Customize playlists with colors, moods, text, and custom covers
